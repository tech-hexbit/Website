      <h2>12. Fees And Payment</h2>

      <p>
        12.1 Fees and Payment. All charges associated with Customer’s Account
        (“Fees”) are set forth in the Order Form, and are due and payable in
        full within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Payment obligations
        are non-cancelable, regardless of utilization by the Customer and except
        as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Fees paid are non-refundable.
        Customer will pay the Fees through an accepted payment method as
        specified in the Order form. Customer’s subscription to the Services
        will renew automatically for a Subscription Term in accordance with the
        renewal terms and conditions set forth in Section 13(b) below.
      </p>

      <p>
        12.2 Late Payments. If undisputed Fees are more than thirty (30) days
        overdue, then, following written notification from Hexbit, Hexbit may
        suspend Customer’s access to the Services and/or Mobile Apps, including,
        without limitation, Customer’s Account, until such unpaid Fees are paid
        in full.
      </p>

      <p>
        12.3 Payment Disputes. Hexbit will not exercise its rights under Section
        12(b) (Late Payments), 13(d) (Termination for Cause) or Section 13(c)(i)
        (Suspension of Service) with respect to non-payment by Customer if
        Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good
        faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If the
        parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days,
        each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under
        this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that
        would limit remedies on account of a dispute. For clarity, any
        undisputed amounts must be paid in full.
      </p>

      <p>
        12.4 Applicable Taxes. The Fees are inclusive of all local taxes,
        including GST. Customer agrees to pay applicable direct or indirect
        Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, which, to the extent
        Hexbit is legally required to collect the same, will be itemized on the
        Hexbit invoice.
      </p>

      <p>
        12.5 Orders by Affiliates. Customer’s Affiliates may purchase Services
        directly from Hexbit by executing a separate agreement. If the Affiliate
        resides in a different country than Customer, then the agreement would
        include modifications to terms applicable to the transaction(s)
        (including but not limited to tax terms and governing law).
      </p>

      <h2>13. Term, Termination And Suspension</h2>

      <p>
        13.1 Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date (or, for
        online Customers, the date of sign up on the Website) and will continue
        through the then-current Subscription Term. Service Plans commence on
        the start date specified on the plans or as specified in the “Order
        Form” or “ Supplement terms(wherever applicable)“ and continue for the
        Subscription Term specified therein.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.2 Renewal. Unless a party gives written notice of non-renewal at
        least Thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the relevant
        Subscription Term, Service Plans will automatically renew for a period
        equal to the previous Subscription Term or one year (whichever is
        shorter). Hexbit reserves the right to increase the Fees at the
        beginning of each Subscription Term.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.3 Suspension. Hexbit may suspend Customer’s access to the Services,
        Software, Mobile Apps and/or Customer’s Account, on the following
        grounds: (i) late payment/non-payment of undisputed Fees, per the
        process noted in Section 12 above; (ii) non-renewal of the Services by
        Customer; (iii) Customer’s or its Users’ breach of Section 6 (Use
        Restrictions); or (iv) in the event suspension is deemed necessary by
        Hexbit to prevent or address the introduction of Malicious Software, a
        security incident, or other harm to Customer, Hexbit, or Hexbit' other
        customers. Hexbit will notify Customer of any such suspension. Hexbit
        will use diligent efforts to attempt to limit, where commercially
        feasible, the suspension to affected Users or Hexbit Technology, and
        will immediately restore the availability of the same as soon as the
        issues leading to the suspension are resolved. Such suspension will in
        no way affect Customer’s other obligations under this Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.4 Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement
        within Thirty (30) days by written notice to the other party in the
        event that (i) such other party materially breaches this Agreement and
        does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days of such notice, or
        (ii) immediately in the event the other party becomes the subject of a
        petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency,
        receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.5 Free Trial Customers. Upon the expiration of Customer’s free trial,
        Hexbit may immediately suspend Customer’s access to the Services.
        Customer must export Customer Data before the end of the free trial or
        Customer Data will be permanently deleted. Hexbit will have no
        obligation to maintain, store or otherwise retain Customer Data beyond
        the end of the free trial period.
      </p>

      <p>
        13.6 Data Export. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for
        any reason, Customer’s access to the Services, Software, Mobile Apps,
        APIs and other Hexbit Technology will terminate. Hexbit strongly
        recommends that Customer export all Customer Data before Customer closes
        Customer’s Account. Customer agrees, following the termination or
        expiration of this Agreement or an unrenewed Subscription Term, that
        Customer Data will be deleted.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Confidentiality</h2>

      <p>
        Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information from
        unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as it
        protects its own Confidential Information of similar nature or
        importance, and in any event, using no less than reasonable care. Except
        as otherwise expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, the
        receiving party may use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information
        solely to exercise its respective rights and perform its respective
        obligations under this Agreement, and will disclose such Confidential
        Information solely to those of its respective employees, representatives
        and agents who have a need to know such Confidential Information for
        such purposes and who are bound by obligations to maintain the
        confidentiality of, and not misuse, such Confidential Information. The
        provisions of this section will supersede any non-disclosure agreement
        by and between the parties entered into prior to this Agreement that
        would purport to address the confidentiality of any information shared
        by the parties, including Customer Data, and such agreement will have no
        further force or effect with respect to the foregoing. If the receiving
        party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential
        Information of the disclosing party, then the receiving party will, to
        the extent legally permitted, provide the disclosing party with advance
        written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential
        treatment of the Confidential Information.
